# RNA-Seq-Derived Biomarker Panel and Pathway Discovery for Multi-Class Cancer Subtype Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a robust machine learning pipeline to analyze high-dimensional RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), successfully classifying five distinct cancer subtypes (BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD). The pipeline goes beyond simple prediction, utilizing model interpretability (Logistic Regression coefficients) to establish a definitive 50-gene biomarker panel and validate its functional significance via external bioinformatics pathway analysis.

## 🚀 Key Results & Highlights

* **Prediction:** Achieved **100% F1-Macro Score** on unseen test data using a Logistic Regression classifier, demonstrating perfect discriminative power.

* **Biomarker Panel:** Identified and prioritized a high-confidence panel of **50 most influential HGNC-verified genes** driving the classification.

* **Novel Discovery:** Pathway Enrichment Analysis (gProfiler) confirmed statistical over-representation in **DNA-binding Transcription Factor Activity** and **Syntaxin Binding/Vesicular Transport** pathways, pinpointing core disease mechanisms.

* **Problem-Solving:** Successfully overcame a common bioinformatics challenge by mapping custom dataset gene IDs (`gene_XXXX`) to official **HGNC Symbols** to enable external validation.

* **Therapeutic Candidates:** Identified specific genes (e.g., **STXBP3**, **AIM2**) as high-priority therapeutic targets for future research.

## 🔬 Project Pipeline Phases

### **Phase 1-4: Data Processing and Model Training (Scripts `1_...` to `3_...`)**

* **Data Acquisition:** Utilized 801 samples across five TCGA cancer subtypes (BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD) and 20,531 gene features.

* **Feature Selection:** Reduced feature space from 20,531 to 1,000 using a high-variance filter.

* **Modeling:** Implemented a Class-Weighted Logistic Regression model to mitigate dataset imbalance and ensure model interpretability.

* **Performance:** Final model yielded 100% accuracy and F1-Macro score on the test set.

### **Phase 5: Biological Interpretation and Therapeutic Target Discovery (Script `4_interpret_biomarkers.py`)**

This phase translates the mathematical success of the model into biological meaning.

#### **5.1 Model Interpretation (Coefficient Analysis)**

The Logistic Regression model's coefficients were used to rank all 1,000 features by their predictive magnitude.

* **Outcome:** A panel of **50 most influential genes** was isolated, proving that the model relies on a sparse, specific set of genes for classification. The most potent biomarker, **STXBP3**, was identified as the primary driver for LUAD classification.

#### **5.2 Pathway Enrichment and Validation**

The final biomarker panel was validated using external bioinformatics tools.

| Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Challenge** | The original dataset used custom gene IDs (`gene_15898`) that were unrecognized by standard tools (gProfiler). |
| **Solution** | A dedicated data mapping exercise was performed, confirming that the numeric identifier corresponded to the official **HGNC ID**, allowing for the successful conversion of the entire panel to verifiable symbols (e.g., STXBP3, AIM2). |
| **Key Findings** | Pathway analysis (gProfiler) confirmed that the predictive power is concentrated in two major biological areas: **DNA-binding transcription factor activity** and **syntaxin binding/vesicular transport** (driven by the STXBP family). |
